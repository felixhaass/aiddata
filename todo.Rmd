## To Do:

- Section code lookup table
- Lookup function for aid project by ID, using httr's BROWSE function.
- User input on which fields to download


## Questions

- How do I get GIS precision codes? They don't seem to be in the GIS API result
- Directly access project information instead of queries => would be relevant for linking API GIS result and project information
- Speed of AidData requests: is looping over the resulting pages the valid solution? Or is there anything quicker?
- 

## Thoughts
Why `aiddata` package is useful over existing research releases

- Research release only AidData 2.1, existing version 3.0
- Most recent data available
- GIS data

Downside

- Not easily reproducible data, because databse is constantly uploaded. For research purposes use research releases or store snaphsot on your hard drive & distribute it with your research code.
