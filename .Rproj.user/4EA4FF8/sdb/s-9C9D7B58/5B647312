They don't seem to be in the GIS API result\n- Directly access project information instead of queries => would be relevant for linking API GIS result and project information\n- Speed of AidData requests: is looping over the resulting pages the valid solution? Or is there anything quicker?\n- \n\n## Thoughts\nWhy `aiddata` package is useful over existing research releases\n\n- Research release only AidData 2.1, existing version 3.0\n- Most recent data available\n- GIS data\n\nDownside\n\n- Not easily reproducible data, because databse is constantly uploaded. For research purposes use research releases or store snaphsot on your hard drive & distribute it with your research code.\n\n",
